  # MVC Tech Blog - Challenge 14

  ## Description: 
  Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!

  Our challenge this module was to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. We built this site completely from scratch and deployed it to Heroku. Our app was to follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, use Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
  
  I was able to nail down the structure mostly but still have a ways to go to acheive full functionality. The scale of the labor was the main obstacle for me. I'm still working on codifying my workflow. It's something!
